**Course Description:** This course introduces the different concepts and methods of simulation. Students investigate using discrete-event simulation (DES) to solve complex systems such as healthcare or manufacturing processes. The course emphasizes the fundamental concepts and interpretation of results from process and agent-centric models. The course includes topics such as 1) basic concepts of modeling and simulation, 2) Queuing theory, 3) statistical distribution, 4) working with simulation software, 5) solving case studies, 6) healthcare systems modeling, 7) Statistical result analysis of simulation output, 8) Presenting simulation using Graphical User Interface (GUI), and 9) Model verification and validation. This course is offered separately for graduate and undergraduate students in an alternative semester. The graduate students learn advanced modules of programming simulation logic.  

**Class Enrollment:** 5 graduate students enrolled in this course.

**Student Evaluation:** N/A
